      "* Lead time: 21 days (relatively long lead time)\n",

      "\n",
      "**Step 2: Explain how each factor contributes to the risk**\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Age: 28**: Young adults are more likely to be busy with work, school, or personal commitments, which can increase the likelihood of a no-show.\n",
      "2. **Lead time: 21 days**: A longer lead time may indicate that the patient has forgotten about the appointment or is less committed to keeping it.\n",
      "3. **SMS received: No**: The lack of a reminder via SMS suggests that the patient may not be engaged with the healthcare system or may not have a reliable means of receiving reminders.\n",
      "4. **Previous no-shows: 2 of 5 appointments (40%)**: A high percentage of previous no-shows indicates a pattern of non-compliance, which increases the likelihood of another no-show.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Step 3: Recommend specific interventions**\n",
      "\n",
      "Based on these risk factors, here are some recommendations to reduce the no-show probability:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **SMS reminders**: Send multiple SMS reminders (e.g., 7-10 days and 2-3 days before the appointment) to ensure the patient receives notifications.\n",
      "2. **Personalized communication**: Use a more personalized approach, such as sending a text message or email with the patient's name and a brief reminder about the appointment.\n",
      "3. **Streamlined scheduling**: Consider offering online scheduling or allowing patients to schedule appointments at times that are more convenient for them (e.g., evenings or weekends).\n",
      "4. **Patient engagement**: Encourage patients to take an active role in their healthcare by providing educational resources, patient portals, and other tools to help them stay engaged.\n",
      "5. **Staff follow-up**: Have staff members follow up with patients who have a history of no-shows to ensure they are aware of the upcoming appointment and to address any concerns or questions they may have.\n",

      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "**Risk Level Explanation:**\n",
      "This appointment has a **high risk** of no-show (68% probability), indicating that the patient is more likely to miss their scheduled visit.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Top 3 Factors Contributing to this Prediction:**\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Long lead time**: The appointment is scheduled 18 days in advance, which can increase the likelihood of forgotten appointments.\n",
      "2. **No SMS reminder**: The patient has not been set up for SMS reminders, a key factor in reducing no-shows.\n",
      "3. **Previous no-show history**: This patient has missed 25% of their previous appointments, suggesting a pattern.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Actionable Recommendations:**\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Enable SMS reminders immediately**: Set up the patient for SMS reminders to increase the chances of them attending the appointment.\n",
      "2. **Consider a phone call reminder 48-72 hours before**: A personal touch can help keep the appointment top-of-mind for the patient.\n",
      "3. **Offer alternative scheduling options (if possible)**: If the patient is at risk of missing their scheduled appointment, consider offering an earlier or later time slot to accommodate their needs.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Important Caveats:**\n",
      "While this prediction suggests a high risk of no-show, it's essential to remember that personal circumstances can always change. Be prepared to adapt and adjust your approach as needed.\n",

      "Based on the critical risk tier, I've developed a structured intervention plan to minimize the likelihood of no-shows for this appointment.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Primary Action**: Schedule an additional phone call 7 days prior to the appointment, focusing on personalized communication.\n",
      "\n",
      "* **Timeline**: Make the phone call 7 days before the scheduled appointment date.\n",
      "* **Communication Script**: \"Hi [Patient], it's [Your Name] from our office. I just wanted to follow up and confirm that you're still planning to attend your upcoming appointment on [Date]. We're looking forward to seeing you then! If you have any questions or concerns, please don't hesitate to reach out.\"\n",
      "* **Backup Plan**: If the patient confirms they won't be attending, schedule a same-day phone call to discuss potential rescheduling options.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Additional Actions**:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **SMS Reminder Intensification**: Send an additional SMS reminder 3 days prior to the appointment, emphasizing the importance of keeping the appointment.\n",
      "2. **Staff Review**: Have one of your available staff members review the patient's file and make a mental note to follow up with them if they don't respond to the phone call.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Success Metrics**:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Patient confirms attendance or reschedules the appointment within 24 hours of the additional phone call.\n",
      "2. Staff reports that the patient has responded positively to the communication efforts, indicating reduced anxiety or uncertainty about the appointment.\n",
