This is particularly true for patients with mobility impairments or those living in rural areas where public transportation options may be limited.\n",
      "\n",
      "• **Complex health needs and appointment overload**: Patients who are high-risk often have multiple chronic conditions that require ongoing care. As a result, they may have a heavy schedule of appointments with various healthcare providers, which can lead to feelings of overwhelm and fatigue. This can cause them to miss or cancel appointments if they feel like they're being pulled in too many directions.\n",
      "\n",
      "• **Social determinants of health**: Patients who are high-risk often face significant social and economic challenges that can impact their ability to keep appointments. For example, they may be struggling with food insecurity, housing instability, or unemployment, which can make it difficult for them to take time off work or find childcare to attend an appointment. These underlying issues can create a sense of urgency and priority around other aspects of life, causing healthcare appointments to fall by the wayside.\n"
